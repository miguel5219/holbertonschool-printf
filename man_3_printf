NAME
      printf

SYNOPSIS
      #include <stdarg.h>
			
			typedef struct print
			{
		  	char *t;
				int (*f)(va_list);
			} print_t;
	
			int _putchar(char c);
			int _printf(const char *format, ...);
			int print_c(va_list c);
			int print_s(va_list s);
			int print_i(va_list i);
			int print_b(va_list b);

DESCRIPTION
			The functions in the printf() produces output according to a format as described below.
			On successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed, excluding the null byte used to end output to strings.

	Format of the format string
			The format string is a character string. The  format string  is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications. 
			Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier.
			The  arguments must correspond properly (after type promotion) with the conversion specifier. 

	The conversion specifier

			A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
	 		
			c				The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, then the resulting character is written
			
			s				The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to a terminating null byte, but do ot include the terminating null byte.
			
			d, i		The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
			
			b				The unsigned int argument is converted to binary notation(b).
		
			%				A '%' is written but no argument is converted. The complete version specification is '%%'


RETURN VALUE
			Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte  used to end output to strings).
			
			If an output error is encountered, a NULL is returned.

EXAMPLES
       To print Pi to five decimal places:

			 #include "main.h"
			 _printf("Character:[%c]\n", 'H');

BUGS
				No known bugs.
